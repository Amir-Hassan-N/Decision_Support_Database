# Accident Data Analysis and DW Implementation | SQL,ETL, SSIS, Python, Power BI
Designed and implemented a complete data solution for accident data analysis, covering data cleaning, warehousing, ETL processes, analysis, and visualization. Key aspects included:

## Data Understanding and Cleaning:
✅ Analyzed three datasets (Crashes, People, and Vehicles) to understand data structure and relationships.
✅ Addressed missing values using statistical imputation (mean/median for numerical data, mode for categorical data) and Python scripting.

## Data Warehousing:
✅ Created a relational database schema in SSMS.
✅ Developed Python scripts using the pyodbc library to populate the database with cleaned data, focusing on efficient batch insertion and managing identity columns.

## ETL Implementation with SSIS:
✅ Duplicated database tables using SSMS.
✅ Developed SSIS packages to:
 ➜ Extract and sample data.
 ➜ Perform data lookups and transformations.
 ➜ Aggregate and sort data.
 ➜ Calculate metrics such as the day-night crash index.
 ➜ Output results to flat files.

## Data Analysis and Visualization:
✅ Designed and implemented a data cube for multidimensional analysis.
✅ Utilized MDX queries to extract insights.
✅ Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize:
➜ Geographical distribution of damage costs.
➜ Crash analysis by street attributes (e.g., lighting conditions, visibility).
➜ Analysis of people involved in crashes (e.g., role, injury classification, age).

This project showcases expertise in the full data lifecycle, from data preparation and ETL to advanced analysis and visualization for business intelligence.
